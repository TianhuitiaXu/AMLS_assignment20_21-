1. Organisation
The project includes 4 main parts - A1, A2, B1, B2, each of which corresponds to a classification problem. 
The 'A1', ‘A2’, ‘B1’ and ‘B2’ folders corressponding to the four tasks in this project, which contain the code files for each task.
  In 'A1', there are ? .py files, each of which was tried to conduct a machine learning model for CeleA gender classification (A1) of the project:
    'LogisticRegression_A1' : a logistic regression model.
    'SVM_A1' : a SVM model.
    'MLP_A1' : a MLP model which contains 3 fully connected layers
    'CNN_A1' : a convolutional neural network which contains 3 convolution layers and 3 fully connected layers
    
  In 'A2', there are ? .py files, each of which was tried to conduct a machine learning model for CeleA facial expression (smiling) classification (A2) of the project:
    'LogisticRegression_A2' : a logistic regression model.
    'SVM_A2' : a SVM model.
    'MLP_A2' : a MLP model which contains 3 fully connected layers
    'CNN_A2' : a convolutional neural network which contains 3 convolution layers and 3 fully connected layers
  
  In 'B1', there are ? .py files, each of which was tried to conduct a machine learning model for Cartoon_set face shape classification (B1) of the project:
    'MLP_B1' : a MLP model which contains 3 fully connected layers
    'CNN_B1' : a convolutional neural network which contains 3 convolution layers and 3 fully connected layers
    
  In 'B2', there are ? .py files, each of which was tried to conduct a machine learning model for Cartoon_set eye color classification (B2) of the project:
    'MLP_B2' : a MLP model which contains 3 fully connected layers
    'CNN_B2' : a convolutional neural network which contains 3 convolution layers and 3 fully connected layers
    
main.py conduct the data preprocessing and run the chosen model for each task and return the train_loss, train_accuracy, test_loss, test_accuracy, respectively.
The estimated time of tunning main.py is
